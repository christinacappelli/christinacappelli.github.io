                                A Brooklyn-based creative technologist and designer. My practice bridges immersive installations, interactive AI works, and strategic brand design‚Äîalways imagining plausible
                                possibilities teetering on the edge of speculation. I blend programming, computational video, and research to reveal the
                                hidden forces‚Äîtechnological, biological, and social‚Äîthat shape our world. By manipulating scale, perception, and
                                identity, I craft experiences and brand narratives that invite audiences to question reality andenvision alternative futures.                             </p>

                                <p>
                                    I‚Äôve been drawn to the intersection of science, art, and technology. What started as tinkering with cameras and
                                    coding simple interactive sketches has evolved into a career dedicated to revealing the invisible rhythms of our
                                    world through speculative design and generative AI. I believe in the power of curiosity, collaboration, and
                                    playful experimentation, and I strive to make a positive impact by crafting experiences that invite audiences to
                                    reimagine their relationship with the unseen forces shaping our lives.

                                <p>
                                    Over the past 12 years I‚Äôve also photographed international campaigns and produced content for Lifetime, the
                                    Travel Channel, and MTV‚Äîexperiences that sharpened my storytelling skills and taught me how to lead complex
                                    productions from concept to completion.
                                </p>

                                    I hold a BFA in Performing Arts and an MPS in Interactive Telecommunications from NYU Tisch. Today, I thrive on
                                    combining technical innovation with strategic creative direction‚Äîcollaborating, experimenting, and pushing
                                    boundaries to deliver work that resonates and inspires.

                                or learning new technologies, I approach each opportunity with enthusiasm
